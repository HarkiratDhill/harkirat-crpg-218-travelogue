                The Golden Temple is located in Amritsar, Punjab, India and is one of the most important religious in Punjab.The Golden Temple holds one of the largest community free kitchen for everyone who goes to the Golden Temple whether they are Sikh People going to pray or are tourists wanting to know more about one of the most important religious sites in Punjab. When I had first had the chance of going to the Golden Temple I was amazed by the surrounding area as I have never seen a Sikh temple be so grand and immense as the Golden Temple. I did however notice despite the size of the Golden Temple it still had many of the core details many Sikh Temples have which made it comforting to see.Many Sikh people go to the Golden Temple for it's importance in Sikh history and religion. When going to the Golden Temple people can see that there are 4 entryways to the temple to signify that people from all walks of life are welcome in the Golden Temple. When I had gone to the Golden Temple I was blown away at the size of the free community kitchen as I had never seen a community kitchen be able to have many people be inside and all haveing an easy time getting around and eating peacfully. Part of the Golden Temple does have damage around the parts of it due to the Blue Star operation done by the military in the hopes of locating suspected terrorists. If you are considering going to the Golden Temple in Amritsar you should know that you must have your headcovered and have your shoes off because it is still a major part of the Sikh people's religion and a holy site. So to show respect to the Sikh people, anyone going to the Golden Temple must have their heads covered and take their shoes off. If you don't have a headcovering there are headcoverings for you to use provided by the Golden Temple aslong as you return them and put them in the box that says "used".

Banff also has a lot of variety of foods ranging from Indian to Chinese style foods due to people from many different types of people come to vist Banff. When I went to Banff I went on the gondala and was stunned by how many mountains were there once I had gotten up to a certain point and was able to see how far the mountains went. Banff also has a nice hiking trail people can go on that lasts for quite a bit of time and has many maps around to help those who may not know where they are directly and help them on the right path. Also there are some customization shops in Banff for various different types of merchandise that people can customize for themselves or for their loved ones. When going to Banff it is ideal to know that there will be many pre-weddings in Banff since it one of the most visited places in Alberta and has many nice views for wedding photo, so it would be important to understand that if you are visiting Banff that there will be many people setting up for pre-weddings which might feel like it is getting in the way of seeing the rest of Banff when going there.

            <p>
                The Genesis Centre is a simple local community centre that has various different things for people of all ages to do and enjoy. When I have gone to the Genesis Centre I often times found myself going to the Saddletowqne libary inside as it would have many different types of books for people to read from childrens novels in the front and in the play area to sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, and mystery novels in the middle section of the libary. The libary also had many private rooms for people to book whether someone is trying to have a study room or a quite place to work. The Genesis Centre also has a YMCA which has a swimming pool for people to enjoy and a upstairs gym which I have used in the past and it has a many of the most ideal parts of a gym with a weight rack in the middle, various types of cardio machines at the walls, weight rack on the leftside of the YMCA gym, and machines for your arms, legs, body at the end of te gym with a track to run on as well. Another part of the Genesis Centre is the Jugo Juice where you can get fresh drinks to relax. When going to the Genesis Centre it is important to note that most of the services provided are to be paided for since the only free things you can have are a libary card and a free daypass for the YMCA, everything else must be paided for inside the Genesis Centre and the ones that are sports related do require a subscription in order to access the facilities, such as the YMCA gym.
